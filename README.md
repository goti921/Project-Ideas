# Project-Ideas
A place to keep track of project ideas for the forgetful me.

1. An app(more of a browser extension) to link relevant webpages by context or whatever the user deems fit. At the start it can
be simply a way for a user to keep track of relevant webpages and later it can be extended by including features like having a
graph of the webpages linking to their relevant webpages as marked by the user and also giving the user the option to view what
others have linked to the same webpage.

2. An app to collect information regarding the crime prone areas in/around a place(city, district etc...) and show that information demographically. Information retrieval needs to be accurate if doing through automated means like web scraping et al.

3. A web app to extract all links from a webpage and show it descriptively to the user by leveraging the meta information of the links.

4. A domain specific chatbot for the AI/ML enthusiast inside me(but the lazy human I am, this might take some time).

5. Definitely a website/blog.
